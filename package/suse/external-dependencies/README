This directory contains spec files for modules that may not be part of
your distribution.

Please note that not all of these may have to be built by yourself, you
may want to check your distribution if it ships the necessary module.

The spec files reference versions known to work with OpenXPKI. You may
use higher versions, but it is not recommended to deliberately downgrade.
