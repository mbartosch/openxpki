Morphix is a live CD builder based on Knoppix and Debian.

Here, you can find the input files to build the OpenXPKI Live CD.
To build, you'll first need to install the morphing-tools:
 * Add "deb http://www.morphix.org/debian ./" to your /etc/apt/source.list
 * apt-get update
 * apt-get install morphing-tools 

Then, run ./build.sh which will create a file named openxpki_live.iso
after quite a while.

The OpenXPKI Live CD is currently in beta. It contains a fully deployed
OpenXPKI using MySQL as the database backend and a fully configured
mod_perl-based web interface.
For now, it serves as a quick demonstration of OpenXPKI's features.
In the future, it may also serve as a quick way to install OpenXPKI
and use it (for example as an offline CA together with a USB storage
device)
