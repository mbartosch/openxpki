This directory contains a Java program that can be used to create
Java keystore including a private key (which is something that can
not be done using keytool).
To install, copy the jar file somewhere and configure the location of it
in create_javakeystore.sh.
Configure OpenXPKI to use the shell script as a shell for the corresponding
token.
