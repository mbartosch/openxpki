Customizing messages

OpenXPKI ships with a default set of translations (LANG/openxpki.po). This
catalog will naturally change as the project evolves.

If you need to modify or add translations (e. g. you do not like the
default translation or you have extended the system in a way that it
uses additional I18N tags) it is recommended not to modify openxpki.po,
because keeping up with changes in the project will become difficult for
you.

Instead you should generate a file <LANG>/openxpki.po.local (same format
as the normal .po file) in which you specifically include all additional
translations and all translations you would like to override.

If such a file is detected by the 'make' operation, it will include
your local changes in the machine translation file. (We do not ship
a sample file under version control in order to allow you to have
a local file that will not be overwritten by subsequent checkouts.)
