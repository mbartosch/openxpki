Coding Style
============

If you want to contribute code or you are already a developer
then please respect our coding style. We only enforce a style
to make a better maintenance. If you do not like the style or
you have an idea to improve the style then please start a
discussion on our developer list.

perltidy --profile=perltidyrc -b `find . -name "*.pm" | grep -v "/\.svn"`

Testing
=======

If you want to test the code with "make test" then you can
activate the offline mode with the environment variable OFFLINE.
If this variable is set to a true value of Perl then the test
code knows that you are working offline and avoid any tests
which need an internet connection.

Example:

OFFLINE=1 make test
