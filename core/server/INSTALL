Configuration
=============

Please set OPENSSL_PREFIX, OPENSSL_LIB or OPENSSL_INCLUDE if you want to
use a special OpenSSL version (e.g. in /usr/local/ssl).

Dependencies
============

We use the Date::Parse package of Graham Barr's module TimeDate.
This is not the module from Ralf Engelschall's module lcwa.

Sometimes it happens that the depend flag in Makefile.PL is incomplete.
If this happen then you can get the complete list of used modules with
the following REGEX:

find . -name "*.pm" -exec grep "^use " '{}' \; | \
grep -v "warnings" | \
grep -v "strict" | \
grep -v "Test" | \
grep -v "English" | \
grep -v "OpenXPKI" | \
sort | uniq
